Yes I Know I started this very late, I've had a lot of personal Issues going on at home and couldn't find the time to work on anything, Including this proejct

17:30 I rebooted the Project and Began Catching up to everyone else

17:35 I had issues Finding the Customers and Admin areas previously, so I Manually deleted them and restarted those steps

17:57 Added to my ReadMe the work I Have done so far, as well as a comment before it, I also have just finished P1 completely and it runs

18:00 Taking a short break to mentally recharge and Finish all of P2 by the end of Tonight, also Starting up my Spotify Gym playlist to get me hyped
    If You're curious, I'll leave the link here: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/50Kdj1XOTODBbMpNjOZ9MD?si=F33zscj4T9-NVnsrIBVGVA&utm_source=copy-link
        It's much smaller than my Main playlist, However I'm looking to keep myself Energized, and don't wanna get distracted by skipping songs and losing track of my thought process

18:25 Finished Taking my Break and I am now ready to Progress with the Rest of what is due for Tomorrow, Nov 15th
